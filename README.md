# Custom-Data-Structures
Manually Implemented Data Structures

This repository contains data structures that may be of use in common java practice.
Feel free to use any file for programming use.

***IMPORTANT***:
The MixedDictionary class inherits from the Dictionary class and also uses the AnyType class so do not exclude them when using it.
The MixedList class uses the AnyType class so the AnyType class should not be excluded.
The MixedArray class uses the AnyType class so the AnyType class should not be excluded.
